1.Traffic Analysis Essentials

Task 1 - Introduction

Begin by introducing the concept of network security as a crucial aspect of cybersecurity.
Define network security as a set of operations aimed at protecting data, applications, devices, and systems connected to a network.
Highlight the significance of network security within the broader field of cybersecurity.
Explain that traffic analysis is a subdomain of network security, focusing on investigating network data to identify problems and anomalies.
Emphasize the importance of understanding the foundational concepts of network security and traffic analysis before delving deeper into traffic/packet analysis.

Task 2 - Network Security and Network Data

Describe the core concepts of network security, focusing on authentication and authorization.
Explain the three base control levels of network security: Physical, Technical, and Administrative.
Detail the main approaches and key elements of network security, including access control and threat control.
Discuss typical network security management operations and the role of Managed Security Services (MSS).

Task 3 - Traffic Analysis

Define traffic analysis as a method of intercepting, recording/monitoring, and analyzing network data and communication patterns.
Explain the importance of traffic analysis in addressing both operational issues (e.g., system availability, performance measurement) and security issues (e.g., anomaly detection, threat response).
Discuss the two main techniques used in traffic analysis: Flow Analysis and Packet Analysis.
Highlight the benefits of traffic analysis, such as providing full network visibility and aiding in anomaly and threat detection.

2.Snort

In this room, we'll delve into Snort, an open-source, rule-based Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (NIDS/NIPS) maintained by Martin Roesch and the Cisco Talos team. Snort is renowned as the leading Open Source Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), leveraging a set of rules to identify malicious network activity, generate alerts, and protect against potential threats. Explore how to utilize Snort for real-time threat detection, analyze stored traffic files, and pinpoint anomalies, enhancing our understanding of network security.

Task 2: Interactive Material and VM
This task initiated our journey into understanding Snort by introducing us to basic script execution within its environment. By running the easy.sh script, we received the feedback "Too Easy!" This simple exercise likely aimed to familiarize participants with the environment and boost their confidence.

Task 3: Introduction to IDS/IPS
NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System): This system monitors network traffic across an entire subnet. It identifies and generates alerts for potentially malicious activities based on predefined signatures.

HIDS (Host-based Intrusion Detection System): Unlike NIDS, HIDS focuses on monitoring activity on individual host devices. It alerts administrators to suspicious behavior occurring on a single endpoint.

NIPS (Network Intrusion Prevention System): Similar to NIDS, NIPS monitors network traffic for malicious activity. However, it also has the capability to take preventive action, such as terminating connections or blocking traffic, when it detects a threat.

NBA (Network Behavior Analysis): NBA systems analyze network traffic patterns over time to establish a baseline of normal behavior. Any deviation from this baseline may indicate a security threat.

This task provided an overview of different types of intrusion detection and prevention systems, emphasizing their roles and how they contribute to network security.

Task 4: First Interaction with Snort
Build number: 149
Rules loaded with "snort.conf": 4151
Rules loaded with "snortv2.conf": 1

Participants took their first steps into Snort by obtaining essential information about the system's build version and the number of rules loaded using two different configuration files: the default snort.conf and an alternative snortv2.conf. This provided a foundational understanding of Snort's configuration and rule management.

Task 5: Operation Mode 1: Sniffer Mode
Parameters used for sniffing packets: -v, -d, -e, -X, -i
Explanation: In this task, participants experimented with Snort's sniffer mode, employing various parameters to capture packets and observe network traffic closely. This hands-on experience helped in understanding how to configure and utilize Snort for packet sniffing purposes effectively.

Task 6: Operation Mode 2: Packet Logger Mode
Investigated traffic with ASCII mode, identified source port: 3009
Identified IP ID of 10th packet: 49313
Identified referer of 4th packet: http://www.ethereal.com/development.html
Ack number of 8th packet: 0x38AFFFF3
Number of TCP port 80 packets: 41
Explanation: Participants delved into Snort's packet logger mode, examining captured packets and extracting specific information such as source ports, IP IDs, referers, acknowledgment numbers, and the frequency of packets on TCP port 80. This exercise honed skills in packet analysis and interpreting network traffic data.

Task 7: Operation Mode 3: IDS/IPS
Detected HTTP GET methods: 2
Explanation: Configuring Snort to operate as an Intrusion Detection System/Intrusion Prevention System (IDS/IPS), participants successfully detected HTTP GET methods within network traffic. This practical application of Snort's capabilities enhanced understanding of its role in identifying potential threats.

Task 8: Operation Mode 4: PCAP Investigation
Investigated "mx-1.pcap" file, generated alerts: 170
Number of TCP Segments Queued: 18
Number of HTTP response headers extracted: 3
Investigated "mx-2.pcap" file, generated alerts: 340
Number of detected TCP packets: 82
Investigated "mx-2.pcap" and "mx-3.pcap" files, generated alerts: 1020
Explanation: Participants analyzed Packet Capture (PCAP) files using Snort, generating alerts and extracting valuable information such as the number of queued TCP segments, HTTP response headers, and total detected packets. This exercise strengthened proficiency in using Snort for real-world network traffic analysis.

Task 9: Snort Rule Structure
Filtered packets with IP ID "35369", detected request name: TIMESTAMP REQUEST
Filtered packets with Syn flag, detected packets: 1
Filtered packets with Push-Ack flags, detected packets: 216
Filtered packets with the same source and destination IP, detected packets: 7
Explanation: By understanding and applying Snort's rule structure, participants filtered packets based on specific criteria such as IP IDs, TCP flags (SYN, PUSH-ACK), and source/destination IP addresses. This exercise provided hands-on experience in creating and implementing rules for traffic filtering.

Task 10: Snort2 Operation Logic: Points to Remember
Overviewed the main configuration file (snort.conf).
Explored network variables, decoder configuration, and output plugins.
Learned about DAQ (Data Acquisition) modules and their modes.
Explanation: Participants familiarized themselves with the operational logic of Snort, studying components such as the main configuration file, network variables, decoder settings, output plugins, and the role of DAQ modules in packet acquisition. This comprehensive overview laid the groundwork for further exploration and utilization of Snort's capabilities in network security.

Exploration into Snort has been comprehensive, providing valuable insights and practical experience in utilizing its features for network security purposes. Excited to continue learning and delving deeper into the realm of network intrusion detection and prevention with Snort!
