### Topic : Database Users and Database Administrators
----

During our flipped class session we learned about the differences between the database users and administrators, moreover we learned about their type and roles and responsibilities.
Here's some point:
*Actually database users means it work with the database to conduct a variety of functions, including querying, inserting, updating, and removing data. However, database administrators are responsible for the management, configuration, maintenance, and security of the database system. 

Type of database users:
*Database Administrator (DBA)
*Naive
*System Analyst 
*Sophisticated Users
*Database Designers
*Application Programmers
*Casual Users / Temporary Users
*Specialized users

Roles and Responsibilities of database administrators:
*Managing the relationship with vendors
*Keeping data safe
*Making data easy

This are the thing i came to know and learned during the flipped class session.

During the flipped class what i did was we were divided into groups and given the topics which i mention above so, we discuss the topic and shared among us what we know in a given periods of time.In the same way after that again we are splitted into different groups with different members and did the same thing.

During the filpped class session i think there should more activities rather than just dicussing and sharing eachother. I mean like effective note taking, using additional resousres and active participation.
