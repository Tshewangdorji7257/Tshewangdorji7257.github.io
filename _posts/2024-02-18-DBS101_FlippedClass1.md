### Topic : Database Users and Database Administrators

During our flipped class session we learned about the differences between the database users and administrators, moreover we learned about their type and roles and responsibilities.
Here's some point:
*Actually database users means it work with the database to conduct a variety of functions, including querying, inserting, updating, and removing data. However, database administrators are responsible for the management, configuration, maintenance, and security of the database system. 

Type of database users:

*Naive
*System Analyst 
*Sophisticated Users
*Database Designers
*Application Programmers
*Casual Users / Temporary Users
*Specialized users

Roles and Responsibilities of database administrators:

This are the thing i came to know and learned during the flipped class session.
During the flipped class, we were divided into groups and given specific topics to discuss. Within our groups, we shared our knowledge on the assigned topics within a given period of time. Following this, we were then split into different groups with different members and repeated the process.

During the filpped class session, i beleive there should be more activities rather than just dicussing and sharing with eachother. I mean activities such as effective note-taking, using additional resousres, and active participation.
