Introduction:
In today's digital landscape, web applications have become an essential part of our daily lives, enabling everything from online shopping to social networking. However, with their simplicity comes the potential of security flaws, which may risk critical data and lead to unwanted attacks. This provide a beginner-friendly overview of typical web application security vulnerabilities, as defined by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), as well as practical insights into their exploitation.

1.Broken Access Control
![alt text](../sws.png)
Broken access control refers to a critical vulnerability in web applications where the intended restrictions on accessing certain pages or functionalities are not properly enforced. Essentially, it allows unauthorized users to gain access to protected areas or perform actions they shouldn't be able to. This breach in security can have serious consequences, such as exposing sensitive information or allowing unauthorized manipulation of the application's features.

For instance, consider a scenario where a website's admin panel is meant to be accessible only to privileged users, such as administrators. If a regular visitor can somehow access this admin panel, they might be able to view sensitive data from other users or perform actions reserved for administrators, such as modifying user accounts or deleting content.

An illustrative example of broken access control vulnerability occurred in 2019 with YouTube's private video feature. An attacker discovered that they could access individual frames from private videos, contrary to the expected behavior where private videos should be inaccessible to anyone except the owner. By exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker could reconstruct the video, highlighting the severity of the issue.

In essence, broken access control facilitates unauthorized access to protected resources, undermining the security and integrity of web applications. It underscores the importance of robust access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and safeguard sensitive data and functionalities.

Broken Access Control (IDOR Challenge)
Deploy the machine and go to http://10.10.166.36
Login with the provided username "noot" and password "test1234".
Once logged in, navigate to the section where users' notes are stored.
Try accessing the notes of other users by manipulating the URL parameters, specifically the ID parameter.
Change the ID parameter in the URL to try accessing different users' notes.
Keep testing different ID values until we find the flag, which should be stored in one of the notes.
http://10.10.166.36/note.php?note_id=0

In this case, the flag was obtained using the ID=0, and the challenges were successfully completed

2.Cryptographic Failures

Cryptographic failures in web apps happen when encryption isn't used properly, leaving sensitive info vulnerable. Let's take a secure email app as an example:

Data in Transit: When we check our email in a web browser, we want our messages to be encrypted while traveling between our device and the server. This stops eavesdroppers from snooping on emails.

Data at Rest: Emails are stored on the email provider's server. It's important to encrypt them there too, so even the provider can't read them.

Cryptographic failures can lead to leaks of personal data like names, birthdays, and financial details. Sometimes, attackers can exploit weak encryption to intercept data, even without advanced skills.To prevent these issues, developers need to use strong encryption and regularly check for vulnerabilities in their web apps. This helps keep user data safe from prying eyes.

Cryptographic Failures (Supporting Material 1)
Databases are critical components of web applications because they store enormous amounts of data that may be accessed from multiple locations. While dedicated database servers such as MySQL are prevalent in production situations, smaller applications may use flat-file databases, which are kept directly on the server as single files for convenience.

However, when these flat-file databases are accidentally installed in the root directory of a web application, there is a serious security risk. This oversight allows anyone who visits the website to download and query the database, possibly exposing sensitive information.

SQLite databases, a prevalent format for flat-file databases, can be easily interacted with using tools like sqlite3. Let's walk through a scenario:

Identifying the Database: Upon downloading the database file (e.g., example.db), a simple command like ls -l reveals its presence.
Accessing the Database: Using the sqlite3 command followed by the database name (e.g., sqlite3 example.db), we can access the database for querying.
Viewing Database Structure: The .tables command within the sqlite3 prompt displays the tables present in the database, giving us insight into its structure.
Extracting Data: With the SELECT * FROM table_name; command, we can dump the data stored in a specific table. However, understanding the data's meaning might require examining the table information first.

For instance, suppose it have a table named 'customers' with columns like custID, custName, creditCard, and password. Extracting data from this table reveals sensitive information such as customer names, credit card numbers, and hashed passwords.

Understanding such vulnerabilities highlights the importance of secure database management in web applications. Placing databases outside the web server's public directory and implementing robust encryption for sensitive data are crucial steps in mitigating the risk of data exposure.

Cryptographic Failures (Supporting Material 2)
In the previous, explored how to query an SQLite database to find password hashes of users. Now, let's delve into cracking these hashes to reveal the actual passwords.

For this, we'll utilize Crackstation, an online tool adept at cracking weak password hashes, particularly MD5 hashes. Here's a quick walkthrough:

Accessing Crackstation: Navigate to the Crackstation website, which provides a user-friendly interface for hash cracking.
Inputting the Hash: Paste the password hash (e.g., 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99) into the provided field. Solve the Captcha to proceed.
Cracking the Hash: Click on the "Crack Hashes" button to initiate the cracking process.
Viewing the Result: Upon successful cracking, Crackstation will display the decrypted password associated with the hash. In our example, we found that the password for Joy Paulson was "password".

It's important to note that Crackstation operates using an extensive wordlist. If a password is not present in this list, Crackstation may fail to crack the hash.In the context of challenge, if Crackstation fails to crack a hash, it's likely intentionally designed to resist cracking attempts, perhaps using more sophisticated encryption techniques.
By leveraging tools like Crackstation, we shed light on the vulnerability of weak password hashes, emphasizing the importance of employing strong, unique passwords to bolster security in web applications.
